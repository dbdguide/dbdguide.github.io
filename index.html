        <p>Welcome to the DBD guide on how to play including useful tips and tricks about the game, killers, survivors, builds, etc. I hope you enjoy and learn something new. If you find anything useful missing please let me know and i'll be sure to add it in.</p>
        
        <p>The main objective it to repair 5 generators and escape by opening the exit door. While doing this you must run away from the killer while your team does generators. They are required to complete skill checks when repairing generators which is a popup on screen and requires you to click within the box otherwise the gen will blow up and lose some progress.</p>
        
        <h2>In Depth Info</h2>
        
        <h3>Repairing:</h3>
        <p>To power up the Exit Gates and escape, Survivors must repair 5 of the 7 generators located throughout the map. Skill checks will appear as you work on generators. Fail one and the Killer will be alerted, and your repair progress set back. Multiple Survivors working on the same generator at once will speed up repairs.</p>
        
        <h3>Looping the killer:</h3>
        <p>Most Killers are faster than Survivors. Avoid running in a straight line. Instead, drop pallets in the Killer's path, blind them with a flashlight, or vault through windows to get away. Running will leave scratch marks for them to follow. Walk, crouch, or hide in lockers to avoid detection. The longer the chase, the more time your allies have to focus on generators.</p>
        
        <p>If struck twice by the Killer you'll enter the Dying State where you can be picked up and impaled on a sacrificial hook. Attempt to wiggle free while being carried. If hooked, you'll need to rely on your allies to rescue you before the sacrifice is complete. Help each other stay alive, repair generators, and power up the Exit Gates to escape before time runs out.</p>

        <h2>How perks/items work:</h2>
        <p>Perks are 3 tiers, for this guide we will assume you have tier 3 to make the most out of the perk. Perks go T1 = Green, T2 = Blue, T3 = Purple. You automatically get the next tier of that characters perks when you prestige (50 levels). Prestige 2 will give you Blue and 3 Purple. Once you hit presitge 1 you can begin unlocking these perks on other characters. In order to get blue and purple you just need to find the perk in the bloodweb 3 times total OR have that perks owner at prestige 3 then you automatically get that characters T3 perks across all your other characters, even new ones you unlock/buy.</p>

        <h2>Killer Hints and tips.</h2>
        
        <div class="killer-tips">
            <h4>Trapper</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep an eye out on the ground for traps</li>
                <li>Avoid patches of tall grass.</li>
                <li>Be careful around obvious vaulting locations like shack window or the windows of various main structures.</li>
                <li>Disarm traps in his setup area early</li>
                <li>Get into an early chase with Trapper. (Why? This stops him roaming the map setting up traps. Make sure you're comfortable looping if you do this)</li>
                <li>Abandon loops if the trapper sets a trap while in chase</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="killer-tips">
            <h4>Wraith</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Can barely be seen while cloaked. Can be heard by beathing noise.</li>
                <li>Vault into cloaked wraith to waste his time</li>
                <li>Use audio cues to detect</li>
                <li>Avoid dropping pallets when he's cloaked</li>
                <li>Have an escape route planned. Know where the nearest window / pallet is when you work on a generator.</li>
                <li>Heal up. Wraith thrives on surprise attacks but suffers if he has to chase through two health states.</li>
                <li>Try to do generators in open areas as a team while keeping safer gens for people who have been hooked before.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="killer-tips">
            <h4>Hillbilly</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Loop wider when Billy is good at curving</li>
                <li>Play safe when Billy is in overdrive mode</li>
                <li>Crouch tech in desperate situations</li>
                <li>Respect the blue chainsaw, please. He becomes a lot more dangerous when you hear the global chainsaw sound and his chainsaw turns blue.</li>
                <li>Play around windows.</li>
                <li>Don't try too hard to hug around props, but it can be great as a final option.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="killer-tips">
            <h4>Nurse</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Run near the edge of the map</li>
                <li>Force her to use both blinks</li>
                <li>Break line of sight and force the Nurse to predict.</li>
                <li>Just generally be unpredictable with your movement.</li>
                <li>If she's charging a blink try to run towards her when she blinks. There's a good chance she'll blink past you, and if you're on a two-story building (or above basement) she'll teleport downstairs.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="killer-tips">
            <h4>Myers</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Avoid feeding myers stalk</li>
                <li>Pester him if he's stalked you</li>
                <li>Treat him like a ranged killer</li>
                <li>Play super safe while looping tier 3</li>
                <li>When he's in Evil Within 3, don't be afraid to use up pallets. Time he wastes in EW3 is time he won't get to use on other people.</li>
                <li>If you think you're going to go down anyways try jumping in a locker, as it wastes more of the killer's time grabbing you out.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="killer-tips">
            <h4>Hag</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Much like Trapper look at the ground.</li>
                <li>You can crouch walk up to traps to wipe them away.</li>
                <li>Playing against Hag is similar to playing against Trapper except you want to avoid high-traffic areas of the map.</li>
                <li>Harass her traps when she's occupied</li>
                <li>Walk into traps with the camera behind you</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="killer-tips">
            <h4>Doctor</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Stay out of the terror radius</li>
                <li>Three shocks and you'll have to stand still to snap out of it. (No gens/healing can be done while in this. You'll also no longer be able to hear where he is as you'll have a constant terror radius on you alongside fake clones of him)</li>
                <li>Connect your loops to other loops</li>
                <li>You can hide in a locker to avoid his big AoE zap.</li>
                <li>If he zaps you, you can't drop pallets or vault for a bit. So like, don't camp pallets. OR Pre-drop pallets if he is getting close.</li>
                <li>Honestly the main thing that makes Doctor oppressive in low tiers of play is how he counters stealth, which is what many new players rely on. His actual chase power isn't that impressive.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="killer-tips">
            <h4>Huntress</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Avoid obvious movement. Don't run in a zig-zag or anything (it'll just make the killer catch up faster) but don't make it obvious you're running to a pallet / window.</li>
                <li>You can try to fake out that you're going to vault a window / drop a pallet. Run towards the window / pallet and then don't drop it / run past it. With luck the Huntress will start pulling up a hatchet and slow down / be unable to hit you.</li>
                <li>Don't be scared of the humming, but do be warry of it. It means she's close, not that she's right on top of you. (Unless it's werelk, then ur fucked anyway)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="killer-tips">
            <h4>Leatherface</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Much like Hillbilly: play around windows. He will most likely have bambam perk and block it so move on to next pallet, window, loop.</li>
                <li>Don't be afraid to drop a pallet when you need to, but please don't drop them all too fast. Try to run around the loop and least once or twice before dropping.</li>
                <li>Unlike Hillbilly hugging small props is a very effective tactic if you have no other options.</li>
                <li>Use windows to vault for most chases</li>
                <li>Greed pallets and mind game his chainsaw sweep</li>
                <li>Don't go down near basements. (If it's basement bubba, just do gens and leave. 1 death is better than 4)</li>
                <li>Locker can save your life. (Just learn the locker timing if he tantrums. Good bubbas may swing mouse left and right really fast making it harder for you to tell.) - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4E00ad2q--w&ab_channel=notOtzdarva" target="_blank">notOtzdarva Guide</a></li>

        </div>

        <div class="killer-tips">
            <h4>Freddy</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Split up when working on generators (He can only TP to one, he can fake though)</li>
                <li>Freddy can now throw out a river of blood that will hinder you, try to dodge this. (It's a straight line attack that goes through walls)</li>
                <li>Freddy also has fake pallets across the map, these are obvious when close from the dripping blood, make sure to break them when he's not around. Don't break them when he's near as he can make them explode and do damage to you.</li>
                <li>You can instantly exit the dream state by failing a skill check</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="killer-tips">
            <h4>Pig</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>If she crouches at a loop, go to the next tile. (If you're experienced you may be able to stay)</li>
                <li>Don't be too scared of completing gens while someone has a Reverse Bear Trap, but it's generally nice to give them some time to try to remove the thing first.</li>
                <li>Remember that Pig doesn't really have many tricks for looping other than her ambush.</li>
                <li>You can still escape with an active trap (RED), the only way to do this is via the hatch.</li>
                <li>Take your hat off ASAP</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="killer-tips">
            <h4>Clown</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Don't be afraid to drop pallets when needed. Predropping is how you counter Clown.</li>
